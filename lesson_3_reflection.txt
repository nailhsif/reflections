When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To collaborate with others, or making cloud copy of my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To prevent some changes from remote mixed up with local files.
